# BattleshipGame

There is a virtual grid having 7 cells, numbered from 0 to 6. A ship is placed in the grid that spans 3 consecutive cells (the starting location is randomly generated). The player has to guess these locations. If the player's guess matches any of the occupied locations, then it's a hit. Otherwise it's a miss. The player needs to have exactly 3 hits (as the ship spans 3 consecutive locations) to make the ship sink. The game ends when the ship sinks and the score (total number of guesses taken by the player to sink the ship) is displayed.
